ImageClassification
===================

A short project on training classfication model on the various images of numbers.

Used the mnist data often referred as the "Hello World" of machine learning.  
There are 70,000 images and each images has 784 features, as its a 28X28 pixels each feature represents a pixel's intensity from 0 to 255. 
An illustration of how we can train a classfication model and challenges of evaluation process that changes as per the requirment of end goals.
